       <h1>ITIS-3135: Raymundo Munoz Cuevas</h1>

       <h2>Website Evaluation</h2>

       <p>to figure out the boundaries between good and greatness</p>


      
       <h3>Bad -   <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">art.yale.edu</a></h3>


      <p> <b>Contrast:</b> The contrast between different elements and groups within the site is not jarring and kind of flows but doesn't blend in at the same time.</p>
      <p> <b>Repetition:</b> not that much repetition considering the gradient colors on many bof the boxes don't really have a uniform pattern. </p>
      <p><b>Alignment:</b> The alignment of some of the boxes are sort of off, and some of the box areas differ wildly in size.</p>
      <p><b>Proximity:</b> Kind of weird proximity of items beside each other, honestly the subject matter sort of ties into each box,except for the fact that its kind of just jumbled onto the same page, when it could be easily placed into a different webpage via a link </p>




       <h3>Good - <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple.com</a></h3>


       <p><b>Contrast:</b> The colors on this site seem related to each other, but not related enough to where it blends in, it makes sense and is easy on the eyes and makes me want to explore more.</p>
       <p> <b>Repetition:</b> Uses the same sizes and same boxing pattern and color scheme is similar enough where it repeats throughout the page, which makes the page nice to look at. </p>
       <p><b>Alignment:</b> Everything is neatly aligned, there is really nothing that is weirdly aligned. Everything seems to fall into place.</p>
      <p><b>Proximity:</b> Everything is close in proximity, especially the related content, since Apple is a tech company most of the options on the most website are related to their tech items, and new updates on the tech and the latest apple tech news.</p>
