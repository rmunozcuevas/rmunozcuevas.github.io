      <h2>Meet Jonathan</h2>

      <p>Hi, I’m Jonathan — founder of JJ’s Book Club. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve had my nose in a book. From reading fantasy novels under the covers late at night, to hosting book discussions at my local library, literature has always been a central part of my life.</p>
      <p>JJ’s Book Club started as a way to connect with friends over books and has grown into a welcoming community of readers. Our goal? To share, learn, and get inspired through stories — and to support local authors along the way.</p>
      <p>My favorite book of all time is <em>The Name of the Wind</em> by Patrick Rothfuss. I love complex characters, rich world-building, and stories that stay with you long after you close the book.</p>
      <p>Thanks for stopping by. I hope to read with you soon!</p>
